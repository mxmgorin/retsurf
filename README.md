# 🌊 retsurf
A lightweight experimental web browser built in **Rust**, using [**Servo**](https://github.com/servo/servo) as the rendering engine and **SDL2** for windowing and input handling.
The goal of this project is to create a web browser that runs without X11 or Wayland and have good gamepad support, targeting embedded handheld consoles and Linux-based devices.

🛠️ *Work in progress: the project is in an early development stage and currently has only limited features.*
